# direct-imaging-sims
Simulate direct imaging observations of exoplanets with WFIRST-CGI

- Models directory contains grids of computed geometric albedo models
- WFIRST_SIM directory contains tools useful for calculating signal to noise ratios, 
simulating mock observations, and carrying out retrievals on those "observations"
- Robinson2016 contains a python version of some of the calculations done in Robinson et al. 2016. 
He has an IDL version on GitHub here: https://github.com/tdrobinson/coronagraph_noise
