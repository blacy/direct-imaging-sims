Planet reflected light curves are the product of the stellar flux, the 
wavelength-dependent geometric albedo, the wavelength- and 
time-dependent orbital phase curve, and the square of the ratio of planet 
radius to planet-star separation.

Here we provide a sample of the two geometric albedo models introduced 
in the paper, "Characterization of Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres with
the Optical Coronagraph on WFIRST", which is available on astro-ph at: 
http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08964 . These two models are inspired by the
giant planets in our own Solar System, and intentionally kept very 
simple due to the modest signal-to-noise ratios and wavelength coverage
expected with WFIRST-CGI.

A GUI which generates planet-star flux ratio light curves using the
formalism introduced in Madhusudhan & Burrows 2012, "Analytic Models for 
Albedos, Phase Curves, and Polarization of Reflected Light from Exoplanets",
is also provided.
